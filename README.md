## 📝 Project Description

This project is a custom-built Content Management System (CMS) designed for bloggers and content creators who want full control over their publishing platform.
It features a rich text editor, media uploads, draft management, post scheduling, and user roles (admin & author). The system provides a clean, user-friendly interface for managing content,
and a public-facing blog to display published posts.

Built with React and Node.js, TypeNest is a modern, full-stack solution for blogging without relying on third-party platforms like WordPress.
